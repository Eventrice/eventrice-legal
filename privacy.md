## Relevant legal basis
The following is an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on the basis of which we process 
personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection 
regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. 
Furthermore, should more specific legal bases be relevant in individual cases, we will inform you 
of these in the data protection declaration.

- **Consent (Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. a) DSGVO)** - The data subject has given his/her consent to the processing of personal data relating to him/her for a specific purpose or purposes.
- **Performance of a contract and pre-contractual requests (Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. b) DSGVO)** - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the performance of pre-contractual measures carried out at the data subject's request.
- **Legal obligation (Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. c) GDPR)** - Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.
- **Legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO)** - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data.

In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, 
national regulations on data protection apply in Switzerland. 
These include, in particular, the Federal Data Protection Act (FADP). 
The DPA applies in particular if no EU/EEC citizens are affected and, for example, 
only data of Swiss citizens is processed.

## Security measures
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, 
taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, 
circumstances and purposes of the processing, as well as the different probabilities of 
occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order 
to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.

The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability 
of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input of, 
disclosure of, assurance of availability of and segregation of the data. 
Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, 
the deletion of data, and responses to data compromise. Furthermore, we already take the protection 
of personal data into account during the development or selection of hardware, software as well 
as procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and 
through data protection-friendly default settings.

TLS encryption (https): To protect your data transmitted via our online offer, we use TLS encryption. 
You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the address bar of your browser.

## Transfer of personal data
In the course of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to 
or disclosed to other bodies, companies, legally independent organizational units or persons. 
Recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or 
providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with 
the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or agreements that serve 
to protect your data with the recipients of your data.

## Data processing in third countries
If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) 
or the processing takes place in the context of the use of third-party services or the disclosure 
or transfer of data to other persons, entities or companies, this is only done in accordance with 
the legal requirements.

Subject to express consent or contractually or legally required transfer, we only process or 
have the data processed in third countries with a recognized level of data protection, 
contractual obligation through so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission, i
n the presence of certifications or binding internal data 
protection regulations (Art. 44 to 49 DSGVO, information page of the EU Commission: 
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_de).

## Deletion of data
The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the legal requirements as soon as their 
consents permitted for processing are revoked or other permissions cease to 
apply (e.g. if the purpose of processing this data has ceased to apply or it is not 
required for the purpose). If the data are not deleted because they are required for 
other and legally permissible purposes, their processing will be limited to these purposes. 
That is, the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, 
to data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law or whose storage is necessary 
for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of 
another natural or legal person.

Our data protection notices may also contain further details on the retention and deletion of data, 
which take priority for the respective processing operations.

## Use of cookies
Cookies are text files that contain data from visited websites or domains and are stored by a 
browser on the user's computer. The primary purpose of a cookie is to store information 
about a user during or after his visit within an online offer. Stored information may include, 
for example, language settings on a website, login status, a shopping cart, or where a video 
was watched. We further include in the term cookies other technologies that perform the same 
functions as cookies (e.g., when user information is stored using pseudonymous online identifiers, 
also referred to as "user IDs")

### The following cookie types and functions are distinguished:

- **Temporary cookies (also: session or session cookies):** Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offer and closed his browser.
- **Permanent cookies:** Permanent cookies remain stored even after the browser is closed. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. Likewise, the interests of users used for reach measurement or marketing purposes can be stored in such a cookie.
- **First-party cookies:** First-party cookies are set by ourselves.
- **Third-party cookies (also: third-party cookies):** Third-party cookies are mainly used by advertisers (so-called third parties) to process user information.
- **Necessary (also: essential or absolutely necessary) cookies:** Cookies may be absolutely necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to store logins or other user input or for security reasons).
- **Statistical, marketing and personalization cookies:** Furthermore, cookies are generally also used in the context of range measurement and when a user's interests or behavior (e.g. viewing certain content, using functions, etc.) on individual websites are stored in a user profile. Such profiles are used, for example, to show users content that matches their potential interests. This process is also referred to as "tracking", i.e., tracking the potential interests of users. Insofar as we use cookies or "tracking" technologies, we will inform you separately in our data protection declaration or in the context of obtaining consent.

### Notes on legal bases
The legal basis on which we process your personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask you 
for consent. If this is the case and you consent to the use of cookies, the legal basis for 
processing your data is your declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of 
cookies is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests 
(e.g. in the business operation of our online offer and its improvement) or, if the use of cookies 
is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations. 

#### Storage period 
Unless we provide you with explicit information on the storage period of permanent 
cookies (e.g. in the context of a so-called cookie opt-in), please assume that the 
storage period can be up to two years.

#### General information on revocation and objection (opt-out)

Depending on whether the processing is based on consent or legal permission, you have the option 
at any time to revoke any consent you have given or to object to the processing of your data 
by cookie technologies (collectively referred to as "opt-out"). 
You can initially declare your objection by means of your browser settings, e.g. by deactivating 
the use of cookies (whereby this may also restrict the functionality of our online offer). 
An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be declared by means 
of a variety of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the 
websites https://optout.aboutads.info and https://www.youronlinechoices.com/. 
In addition, you can obtain further instructions on how to object in the context of 
the information on the service providers and cookies used.

- **Types of data processed:** Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).
- **Data subjects:** Users (e.g., website visitors, users of online services).
- **Legal grounds:** consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a. DSGVO), legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DSGVO).


## Business services
We process data of our contractual and business partners, e.g. customers and prospective 
customers (collectively referred to as "contractual partners") in the context of 
contractual and comparable legal relationships as well as related measures and in 
the context of communication with contractual partners (or pre-contractual), e.g. to answer inquiries.

We process this data in order to fulfill our contractual obligations. This includes, in particular, 
the obligations to provide the agreed services, any update obligations and remedies in the event of 
warranty and other service disruptions. In addition, we process the data to protect our rights 
and for the purpose of administrative tasks associated with these obligations and company 
organization. Furthermore, we process the data on the basis of our legitimate interests in 
proper and business management as well as security measures to protect our contractual partners 
and our business operations from misuse, endangerment of their data, secrets, information and 
rights (e.g. for the involvement of telecommunications, transport and other auxiliary services 
as well as subcontractors, banks, tax and legal advisors, payment service providers or tax authorities). 
Within the framework of applicable law, we only disclose the data of contractual partners to 
third parties to the extent that this is necessary for the aforementioned purposes or to fulfill 
legal obligations. Contractual partners will be informed about further forms of processing, e.g. 
for marketing purposes, within the scope of this data protection declaration.

We inform the contractual partners which data is required for the aforementioned purposes before 
or in the course of data collection, e.g. in online forms, by means of special marking (e.g. colors) 
or symbols (e.g. asterisks or similar), or in person.

We delete the data after the expiry of legal warranty and comparable obligations, i.e., 
generally after 4 years, unless the data is stored in a customer account, e.g., as long as it 
must be kept for legal archiving reasons. The statutory retention period is ten years for documents 
relevant under tax law as well as for commercial books, inventories, opening balances, annual 
financial statements, the work instructions required to understand these documents and other 
organizational documents and accounting records, and six years for received commercial and business 
letters and reproductions of sent commercial and business letters. The period begins with the 
end of the calendar year in which the last entry was made in the book, the inventory, the opening
balance sheet, the annual financial statements or the management report was prepared, the commercial 
or business letter was received or sent, or the accounting document was created, furthermore the 
recording was made or the other documents were created.

Insofar as we use third-party providers or platforms to provide our services, the terms 
and conditions and data protection notices of the respective third-party providers or 
platforms apply in the relationship between the users and the providers.

Further notes on processing operations, procedures and services:

- **Customer account:** Contractual partners can create an account within our online offer (e.g. customer or user account, "customer account" for short). If registration of a customer account is required, contractual partners will be informed of this as well as of the information required for registration. Customer accounts are not public and cannot be indexed by search engines. In the course of registration and subsequent logins and use of the customer account, we store the IP addresses of the customers together with the access times in order to be able to prove registration and prevent any misuse of the customer account. If customers have terminated their customer account, the data relating to the customer account will be deleted, unless their retention is required for legal reasons. It is the responsibility of customers to safeguard their data when their customer account is terminated; legal basis: contract performance and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) DSGVO).
- **Store and e-commerce:** We process the data of our customers to enable them to select, purchase or order the selected products, goods and associated services, as well as their payment and delivery or execution. If necessary for the execution of an order, we use service providers, in particular postal, forwarding and shipping companies, to carry out the delivery, or execution to our customers. For the processing of payment transactions, we use the services of banks and payment service providers. The required information is identified as such in the context of the order or comparable purchase process and includes the information needed for delivery, or provision and billing, as well as contact information in order to be able to contact you if necessary; Legal basis: Contract performance and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) DSGVO).

Offer of software and platform services: We process the data of our users, registered users 
and any test users (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "users") in order to be able to 
provide our contractual services to them as well as on the basis of legitimate interests 
in order to ensure the security of our offer and to be able to develop it further. 
The required information is identified as such in the context of the order, purchase order 
or comparable contract conclusion and includes the information required for the provision 
of services and billing as well as contact information in order to be able to hold any 
consultations; legal basis: contract performance and pre-contractual 
inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) DSGVO).

## Payment procedure
In the context of contractual and other legal relationships, due to legal obligations or 
otherwise on the basis of our legitimate interests, we offer data subjects efficient and 
secure payment options and use other service providers for this purpose in addition to banks and 
credit institutions (collectively, "payment service providers").

The data processed by the payment service providers includes inventory data, such as 
the name and address, bank data, such as account numbers or credit card numbers, passwords, 
TANs and checksums, as well as the contract, total and recipient-related information. 
The information is required in order to carry out the transactions. However, the data 
entered is only processed by the payment service providers and stored with them. I.e., 
we do not receive any account or credit card related information, but only information 
with confirmation or negative information of the payment. Under certain circumstances, 
the payment service providers transmit the data to credit agencies. The purpose of this 
transmission is to check identity and creditworthiness. In this regard, we refer to the 
terms and conditions and data protection information of the payment service providers.

For payment transactions, the terms and conditions and data protection notices of the 
respective payment service providers apply, which can be accessed within the respective 
websites or transaction applications. We also refer to these for the purpose of further 
information and assertion of revocation, information and other data subject rights.

## Newsletter and electronic notifications
We send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications (hereinafter referred to 
as "newsletters") only with the consent of the recipients or a legal permission. If the 
contents of the Newsletter are specifically described in the context of a registration, 
they are decisive for the consent of the users. Otherwise, our newsletters contain information 
about our services and us.

In order to subscribe to our newsletters, it is generally sufficient to provide 
your e-mail address. However, we may ask you to provide a name, for the purpose of personal 
address in the newsletter, or further information, if this is necessary for the purposes of the newsletter.

**Double opt-in procedure:** The registration for our newsletter is always carried out in 
a so-called double opt-in process. This means that after registration you will receive an 
e-mail in which you are asked to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary 
so that no one can register with other e-mail addresses. The registrations for the newsletter 
are logged in order to be able to prove the registration process according to the legal requirements. 
This includes the storage of the registration and confirmation time as well as the IP address. Likewise, changes to your data stored with the dispatch service provider are logged.

**Deletion and restriction of processing:** We may store unsubscribed e-mail addresses for up to three years on the basis of our legitimate interests before deleting them in order to be able to prove consent previously given. The processing of this data will be limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims. An individual request for deletion is possible at any time, provided that the former existence of consent is confirmed at the same time. In the case of obligations to permanently observe objections, we reserve the right to store the e-mail address in a block list (so-called "block list") for this purpose alone.
The logging of the registration process takes place on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of proving its proper course. Insofar as we commission a service provider to send e-mails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure sending system.

We process personal data for the purposes of promotional communication, which may take place via various channels, such as e-mail, telephone, mail or fax, in accordance with legal requirements.

Recipients have the right to revoke consent given at any time or to object to promotional communication at any time.

After revocation or objection, we store the data required to prove the previous authorization to contact or send for up to three years after the end of the year of revocation or objection based on our legitimate interests. The processing of this data is limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims. Based on the legitimate interest of permanently observing the user's revocation or objection, we also store the data required to avoid contacting the user again (e.g., depending on the communication channel, the e-mail address, telephone number, name).

- **Types of data processed:** inventory data (e.g. names, addresses); contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers).
- **Data subjects:** Communication partners.
- **Purposes of processing:** direct marketing (e.g. by e-mail or post).
- **Legal basis:** Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a) DSGVO); Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO).

## Presence in social networks (social media)
We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context in order to communicate with users active there or to offer information about us.

We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This may result in risks for the users because, for example, it could make it more difficult to enforce the rights of the users.

Furthermore, user data is usually processed within social networks for market research and advertising purposes. For example, usage profiles can be created based on the usage behavior and resulting interests of the users. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the users' computers, in which the usage behavior and interests of the users are stored. Furthermore, data independent of the devices used by the users may also be stored in the usage profiles (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them).

For a detailed presentation of the respective forms of processing and the options to object (opt-out), we refer to the privacy statements and information provided by the operators of the respective networks.

In the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights, we would also like to point out that these can be asserted most effectively with the providers. Only the providers have access to the users' data and can take appropriate measures and provide information directly. If you still need assistance, you can contact us.

We incorporate into our online offering functional and content elements that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These can be, for example, graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content").

The "pixel tags" can be used to analyze information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may further be stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of visit and other information about the use of our online offer as well as be linked to such information from other sources.
